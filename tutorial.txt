Template Literals - shorter and easier to read than the "old" way of concatenating strings
 
Template literals are string literals allowing embedded expressions. You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation features with them.

Template literals are enclosed by the backtick (` `)  (grave accent) character instead of double or single quotes.

Template literals can contain placeholders

To escape a backtick in a template literal, put a backslash (\) before the backtick
